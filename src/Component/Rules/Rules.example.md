This demonstrates the usage of the `Rules` component.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { Rules } from 'geostyler';

class RulesExample extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      rules: [{
        name: 'myRule',
        symbolizers: [{
          kind: 'Mark',
          wellKnownName: 'Circle'
        }]
      }, {
        name: 'myRule 2',
        symbolizers: [{
          kind: 'Mark',
          wellKnownName: 'Circle'
        }]
      }]
    };
  }

  render() {
    const {
      rules
    } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        <Rules
          rules={rules}
          onRulesChange={(newRules) => {
            this.setState({
              rules: newRules
            });
          }}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
