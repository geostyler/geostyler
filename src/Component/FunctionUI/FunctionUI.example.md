This demonstrates the usage of the `FunctionUI` component. Choose one of the types
'string', 'number' or 'boolean'. Then select one of the corresponding functions
from the dropdown.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { FunctionUI } from 'geostyler';
import { Radio } from 'antd';

const FunctionUIExample = () => {

  const [type, setType] = useState('string');
  const [gsFunction, setGsFunction] = useState();

  const style = {
    height: '300px',
    width: '300px'
  };

  const onChange = (evt) => {
    setType(evt.target.value);
    setGsFunction();
  };

  return (
    <div style={style}>
      Function Type:
      <Radio.Group onChange={onChange} value={type} >
        <Radio.Button value="string">string</Radio.Button>
        <Radio.Button value="number">number</Radio.Button>
        <Radio.Button value="boolean">boolean</Radio.Button>
      </Radio.Group>
      <div style={{height: '10px'}} />
      <FunctionUI
        type={type}
        value={gsFunction}
        onChange={setGsFunction}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

<FunctionUIExample />
```
