This demonstrates the use of `OlRenderer`.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { OlRenderer } from 'geostyler';

class OlRendererExample extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      symbolizers: [{
        kind: 'Mark',
        wellKnownName: 'circle',
        color: '#ff0000',
        strokeColor: '000000',
        strokeWidth: 3,
        radius: 10
      }],
      symbolizerKind: 'Mark'
    };
  }

  render() {
    const {
      symbolizers,
      symbolizerKind
    } = this.state;

    return (
      <OlRenderer
        symbolizers={symbolizers}
        symbolizerKind={symbolizerKind}
      />
    );
