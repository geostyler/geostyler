This demonstrates the usage of the `RemovableItem` component.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { RemovableItem } from 'geostyler';
import _uniqueId from 'lodash-es/uniqueId';

class RemovableItemExample extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      items: [
        'first item',
        'second item',
        'third item'
      ]
    };

    this.onRemove = this.onRemove.bind(this);
  }

  onRemove(idx) {
    const items = [...this.state.items];
    items.splice(idx, 1)
    this.setState({items});
  }

  render() {
    const { items } = this.state;

    return (
      <>
        {
          items.map((item, idx) => (
            <RemovableItem
              key={_uniqueId()}
              onRemoveClick={() => {
                this.onRemove(idx);
              }}
            >
              <div
                style={{
                  border: 'solid 1px lightgray',
                  margin: '5px',
                  height: '50px'
                }}
              >{item}</div>
            </RemovableItem>
          ))
        }
      </>
    );
  }
}

<RemovableItemExample />
```
